# base-project-python

A repo for a base docker configuration for academic projects in python. See also my [base docker for R projects here](https://github.com/tomwallis/base-project-docker).

This docker environment forks from the [Jupyter docker stacks scipy notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/master/scipy-notebook) and adds a few more packages, including my Python utilities package.

The `example_run_command.sh` runs the docker container and starts a jupyter lab instance.
